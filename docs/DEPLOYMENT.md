The `revisionHistoryLimit` field in your `Deployment` manifest controls **how many old ReplicaSets** Kubernetes should retain **for rollback purposes**.

### ðŸ’¡ Explanation:

- Every time you update a Deployment (e.g., change the container image), Kubernetes creates a **new ReplicaSet** and keeps the old one.
- `revisionHistoryLimit` sets the **maximum number of old ReplicaSets to keep**.
- This helps with:
  - **Rollbacks**: You can quickly revert to a previous version.
  - **Cleanup**: Prevents too many old versions from being stored, saving cluster resources.

### ðŸ”§ In your case:

```yaml
revisionHistoryLimit: 2
```

Kubernetes will:

- Keep the **current ReplicaSet** + the **last 2 previous ones**.
- Delete any older ReplicaSets beyond that limit.

### ðŸ§  TL;DR:

`revisionHistoryLimit: 2` means you can roll back to the **last two versions** of your app. Anything older will be cleaned up automatically.
